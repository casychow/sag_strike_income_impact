# SAG-AFTRA Strike Potential Impact on Income Calculator
The Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild --  American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) are striking about unfair labor situations in the Hollywood scene. Some actors have cited the lack of residuals as reasons for going on strike, despite appearing on popular TV shows as series regulars or guests.

This project shows how much an actor's finances could be impacted based on their expected work hours, their hourly wage[1], their expected overtime work hours, and their overtime hourly wage[2].

[1] Note: the hourly wage is assumed to be constant for this project
[2] Note: the overtime hourly wage is also assumed to be constant
